# Rag-pipeline-beginner-friendly
A beginner-friendly RAG pipeline using LangChain, Pinecone, and Groq. Learn how to combine document search with LLMs to build powerful, context-aware question-answering systems.

# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for Document Q&A

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for question answering over your own documents using Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline combines document retrieval (via vector search) with generative AI to provide accurate, context-aware answers.

## ðŸ“– Whatâ€™s Inside

- **Document Loading & Preprocessing:**  
  Load PDF and text files, clean and annotate them with metadata.

- **Chunking Strategies:**  
  Split documents into manageable pieces using character, token, and sentence-based chunking.

- **Embeddings & Vector Database:**  
  Generate embeddings with Sentence Transformers and store them in Pinecone for efficient similarity search.

- **Querying:**  
  Retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.

- **Answer Generation:**  
  Use [Groq](https://groq.com/) (LLM API) to synthesize answers from retrieved context.

- **Project Ideas & Next Steps:**  
  Suggestions for extending the project and further learning.

## Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-pipeline-notebook.git
cd rag-pipeline-notebook
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code. The first code cell will install all required Python packages:

- `pinecone`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `pymupdf`
- `langchain`
- `langchain-community`
- `langdetect`
- `torch`
- `groq`

Alternatively, you can install them manually:

```bash
pip install pinecone sentence-transformers pymupdf langchain langchain-community langdetect torch groq
```

### 3. **Add Your API Keys**

- Replace `"Your Pinecone API Key"` and `"Your Groq API Key"` in the notebook with your actual API keys.
- **Never commit real API keys to public repositories.**

### 4. **Add Your Documents**

- Place your `.pdf` and `.txt` files in the working directory.
- Update the `docs` list in the notebook to point to your files.

### 5. **Run the Notebook**

- Execute each cell in order.
- Follow the example usage to ask questions about your documents.

## Example Use Case

- Upload your class notes, research papers, or any text/PDF files.
- Ask natural language questions and get synthesized answers based on your own content.

---

## Project Ideas

- Build a custom chatbot for your notes or textbooks.
- Deploy as a web app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [Gradio](https://gradio.app/).
- Experiment with different embedding models or LLM APIs.
- Add multilingual support.

See the notebookâ€™s final section for more ideas!
